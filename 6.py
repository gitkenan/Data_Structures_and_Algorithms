# Let's write a function which can solve the following:
# Given a string of different characters, if there is less than 1 capital letter, refuse to accept the password.

def strictPass(pass):
    splitPass = pass.split('')
    for i in splitPass:
        # if it's not a capital letter, pass
        # else, return and print pass

    #return and print failure


# Hmm... let's take a break. Back tomorrow.
