# Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to my educational shelf of solved problems! Whether they are challenges that popped into my mind or were discovered online, this repository serves as a virtual notepad to showcase my understanding, ability and progression in Python.

## Main Goal

The primary aim of this repository is to enhance my Python programming skills and deepen my understanding of data structures and algorithms. I start by tackling problems and then go the extra mile by adding detailed comments to explain the inner workings of my solutions. The key objective here is to foster a deeper understanding of the code.

## Specific Goals

I aspire to gradually delve into more complex problems and concepts as I progress. While it's true that many of these solutions can be found online, the real value lies in the explanatory comments. Let's face it, as developers, our value is not in how original your code is. The true worth comes from understanding and implementation.

## A Note About Comments

While the conventional code comment etiquette emphasizes brevity and explaining the 'why' of the code, this repository occasionally deviates from that norm. This is done intentionally to facilitate self-education and review, aligning with the repository's primary objective.

## Extra Bonuses

This project offers the added benefit of frequent updates, keeping my Git skills sharp and demonstrating my ongoing commitment to coding. I'm also excited to delve into new areas of Python, such as testing, as part of this learning journey.

Feel free to explore, learn, and share in my journey of growth and discovery!
