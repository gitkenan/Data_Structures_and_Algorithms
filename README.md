## Data Structures and Algorithms
My solutions to various problems that either come to my head or were found online. The goal here is to not stay rusty in my Python skills and generally to have a place to display my work.

# Main goal
The main goal here is to advance my skillset in Python and my understanding. I will first start by solving the problems, moving onto adding comments to explain in more depth how these problems are solved and what the Python commands mean. The main objective
here is to increase understanding.

# Specific goals
I want to slowly become more complex in my problem solving and understanding. Despite some of these solutions being easy to find online, the important thing here is that I display comments which explain to the reader how to understand the solution.
Let's be real, as a developer it's rare we write completely original code, the real value is in understanding and ettiquete. 

# Extra bonues
This project is one which allows for frequent updates which will keep my fresh in my Git skills and show my eagerness to keep contributing to the code. I also look forward to be able to explore and learn new areas in Python such as testing.
